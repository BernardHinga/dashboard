-> Finished navigation UI with working links.
-> Got ntroduced to [<a href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons">React icons</a>] module for easier and less cumbersome use of icons. It makes it unnecessary to download full icon packages, like fontawesome, keeping the app light. Check It Out! Its worth it.
